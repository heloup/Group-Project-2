# Dataset Description:
Our dataset details the NYPD Shooting Incident Data. We obtained our dataset through the website provided(https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nypd-shooting-incident-data-historic). Our dataset comprises various dimensions that represent a range of data types. It includes information such as the borough where the incident occurred, a description of the location of occurrence, and a general location description, all of which fall under the string data type. Other string-type data embedded in this data set include the race, sex, and age group of both the perp and the victim. Additional dimensions provide details about the date, specifically the month and year, and are categorized as the number (whole) data type. The final set of dimensions encompasses the date and time of the offense, classified as the "date & time" data type, and the latitude and longitude, both represented as the "number" data type with decimal precision. Collectively, these dimensions within the dataset allow viewers to gain an in-depth understanding and perspective of the data.

# Question 1:
When comparing NYPD shooting incidents across different racial groups, our primary question is: Among three specific racial groups, which one is associated with the highest number of incidents? Further, within each racial group, we aim to identify the age group most commonly involved in these incidents and if these incidents are most common amongst males or females.

# Question 2:
Our next inquiry focuses on determining which borough has witnessed the highest number of NYPD shooting incidents over the past 17 years.
